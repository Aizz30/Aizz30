I'm Aizz30, a pre-final year BTech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
I'm passionate about coding and currently learning Python on Udemy. I'm interested in 
graphic design and reading as well. I'm looking to collaborate on interesting coding projects 
and learn from other developers on GitHub.
